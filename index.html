				<p>Re(create) is a platform for young artists of Hope Church Singapore to showcase and celebrate their passion for the performing arts. It is also an opportunity for vibrant collaboration between different artists from various ministries, bringing together the young and the experienced to present high quality creative works that are inventive and inspiring.</p>

				<p>It is a night of music, dance, drama, film, and photography, so let the explosion of creative art form draw you to the Creator behind them all!</p>

				<h1>Message from Director</h1>
				<p>In my journey as an artist, I have learnt many valuable lessons that I won’t get to learn if I had not be given a chance to serve in the arts ministry in church. The artists around me shared many of these experiences and lessons – getting stuck in the rut during the brainstorming process until an unexplainable stroke of brilliance got me out of it; the indescribable feeling of seeing people touched by a performance after months of hard work.</p>
				<p>Sometimes, though I only have very limited time to perfect the performance or even finish it, I saw how God showed up at the final hour and made it good enough to bring home the message and touch His people. When I watch performances like this, I begin to contemplate the purpose of rehearsals and why I seek perfection in every show I do.</p>
				<p>Till today, most of it is still a mystery to me each time I direct and create a piece. But when I see myself as a Christian artist I begin to see a common thread underlying these experiences – God’s anointing in me as a Christian artist. I often hear comments about me being the most creative person in church because I am the creative director. But more often than not, I feel so inadequate and fearful before each and every performance. However, when I begin to focus on God and his greatness, I remember that I am first a Christian, then an artist. This is the crux of being a Christian artist. In the Bible there is a verse that always encourages me:</p>
				<p>Exodus 35:31-32</p>
				<p>31 and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills— 32 to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, 33 to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts.</p>
				<p>In this inaugural year of re(create), we want to explore the idea of a Christian artist through different performances and the creative processes that went into conceiving and preparing each one. More than a celebration of art, re(create) is about the God who have graciously given us our gifts. It’s a celebration of God’s goodness in the lives of Christian artists as we re(create) the arts!</p>

				<h1>Program</h1>
				<h3>Music, Dance, Drama, Film, & Photography</h3>
			</div>

			<div id="content" class="grid_12">
				<h2>Blu Jazz café | Dance</h2>
				<p>In this opening dance item set in a funk jazz cafe, follow Daryl, Brandon, Nigel and the team as they journey back to the soul funk era. A live band jazzes up the experience. Enjoy this amalgam of God-given talents and creative expressions, and witness the joys of dancers and musicians working in unison as one body of Christ.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="content" class="grid_12">
				<h2>Awakening | Dance</h2>
				<p>Inspired by their own faith journey, cheoreographers Althea and Zi Fang and their team pour out their strength and bare their hearts in this contemporary dance routine to depict the struggles and difficulties they went through with their faithful God. The routine expresses the heartfelt testimonies of ordinary, flawed human beings who live transformative lives with an extraordinary God.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="content" class="grid_12">
				<h2>The Art of Deception | Drama</h2>
				<p>Two demons compete to bring out the sinful nature of humans and draw them away from God in this comedy on the vulnerability of mankind to the traps and pitfalls of the Enemy. Adapted from two parables in the Bible, this play depicts how seemingly minor issues like spiritual complacency could yield major, dire consequences.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="content" class="grid_12">
				<h2>Listen to Me | Drama</h2>
				<p>We are often quick to present our complaints, laments and whines to God, expecting Him to be all ears. But how often do we listen to what God has to say to us in return? And when God is seemingly silent, does it mean He has nothing to say to us? But perhaps He has already communicated to us in over 30,000 verses in the Bible. "Listen to Me" points us back to the Word and the importance of understanding and living by it.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="content" class="grid_12">
				<h2>Pop Songs Mash Up | Music</h2>
				<p>Four talented heartthrobs (we heard there are a cat lover and nerdy biologist amongst them) will cover a medley of songs from Christian band Anthem Lights. Expect to be blown away by the guys' performance of 2012 hits such as "Can't Shut Up" and "Outta My Mind". Go on, hum and sing along. We promise we won't tell anyone.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="content" class="grid_12">
				<h2>Staring into the Sun  | Film</h2>
				<p>"A death row escapee and a terminally ill young girl meet by chance and take a journey to chase down their last dreams.</p>

				<p>Staring at the Sun is a light-hearted take on the enduring issues of mortality and temporality. Death might be inevitable, but the acceptance of it can sure be upstaged by the many joys and wonders of living."</p>
			</div>

			<div id="content" class="grid_12">
				<h2>Hope | Music & Dance</h2>
				<p>This music and dance routine tells of the how one’s painful past can engulf his soul. However, a loving God can treat each and every one of those hurts. Everlasting hope and peace, despite temporal pains and troubles, is within our reach because of what He has done. This music is originally composed by Kaiwen and his four-piece band.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="content" class="grid_12">
				<h2>What Makes My Heart Bleed? | Music</h2>
				<p>Composed by Cherisse, the song "What makes your heart bleed?" prompts one to consider the state of his heart - is it overcome by self-centred desires such as the meaningless pursuit of popularity and achievements, or does it ache with God for the lost? These artists - Laura on keyboard with Cherisse and Tian Li providing vocal support - remind us that we need to capture God’s heartbeat.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="content" class="grid_12">
				<h2>Finale | Dance</h2>
				<p>"This hip-hop finale conveys the simple joys of being able to breathe, move, and live freely in this world. Every dancer represents a child who is free from the worries of the world because they know a Father who loves them unconditionally. Expect to see familiar childhood games brought to life through hip-hop with music mixed by Jason Ang. When we remember that we are children of God, we realise that we are unique, significant individuals in the eyes of our Father, regardless of our abilities. Knowing Whose we are truly sets us free from insecurity and low self-esteem."</p>
